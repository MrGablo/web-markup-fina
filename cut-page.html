                    <p>In the rush of chopping and preparing ingredients, it’s easy to forget about knife safety. One of the biggest mistakes is failing to use the proper grip, if your fingers are not tucked away, you run the risk of serious cuts. Peeling toward yourself instead of away is another common mistake that can lead to injuries. Using a dull knife is a recipe for disaster; not only does it make cutting more difficult, but it also increases the chances of slipping and hurting yourself. Ignoring the specific purpose of each knife is a misstep too; using a chef’s knife for delicate peeling can lead to accidents.</p>

                    <p>
                        To keep your fingers safe, adopt the “tiger paw” grip by curling your fingers inward and using your knuckles as a guide for the knife. This method allows for better control while keeping your fingertips out of harm’s way. Always peel away from your body and use the right knife for each task, a paring knife for peeling, a chef’s knife for chopping, and a serrated knife for bread. Additionally, ensure your knives are sharp; a well-maintained knife is not only safer but also more effective, allowing for smoother cuts without excessive force.
