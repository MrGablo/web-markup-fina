                    <p>If you skip using <strong><em>oil</em></strong> in a pan while cooking vegetables like onions, you're asking for trouble. Food will <em>stick</em> to the pan, and before you know it, you’ll have burnt 
                        bits instead of a nice, caramelized finish. 
                        Don't crank the heat too high, either; if the water starts boiling violently, the oil will splatter everywhere, which is not only a mess but can be dangerous too. 
                        It's also a mistake to throw vegetables into a dry pan; they will stick and 
                        burn rather than cooking evenly. And if you find yourself getting distracted while cooking, neglecting to stir or check on the food can lead to overcooked, burnt meals.
                    </p>

                        To avoid these mishaps, always add a splash of <strong><em>oil</em></strong> or some moisture to your pan to keep food from sticking. When making something like sofrito, a combination of a cup of water with a small amount of oil works wonders. Just remember to cook on low to medium heat; this allows for gentle cooking without the risk of burning. Setting a timer on your phone can be a lifesaver use it to remind you to stir and check your food regularly. And never forget to add a little water to your vegetables to help them cook without turning into charred remnants.
